ArduinoSocketHTML
=================

###Alter HTML DOM Elements through physical sensors

####Dynamically add HTML DOM elements to a web page using a potentiometer.

Arduino Yun wirelessly sends values across servers using websockets, socket.io and node

socketClient.js lives on the sd card of the Yun, and is called through Arduino sketch.
server.js and index.html live on your web server.

Thanks Tom Igoe & David Tracy
